<p>Actually one thing I forgot - creating the user that way give at a default shell of sh which is pretty useless so a quick login as root and edit of the /etc/passwd file was needed. No, make that two things - lxc containers don&rsquo;t come with sudo installed by default so another quick trip to root to install and add hugo to the sudo group (although doing that previously,when sudo wasn&rsquo;t installed, just completed without error)</p>
