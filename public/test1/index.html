The reason behind such behavior is how Hugo renders pages and site content, especially /static folder, which is described in Hugo docs: https://gohugo.io/content-management/static-files/
/static folder is considered as global storage for all site&rsquo;s static content, e.g. images, stylesheets, scripts and so on. So after rendering Hugo puts them straight into the root of your website.
While path /static/image.png makes perfect sense while editing site contents, after rendering Hugo can not locate stated file and your images do not show up. Then the correct way to include images from /static folder into your post is following:">
