So, if we are not going to bus around the perimeter of England, where shall we go? We have been active members of the [Small Motorhome Community](https://community.smallmotorhome.co.uk/) for years and they are having a twentieth anniversary meet in Teversal near Nottingham in April and one of the more northerly members Gregor is hosting a met up in the borders at Melrose afterwards. So an obvious choice might be to join friends at  both of those and on into  Scotland. But we've toured Scotland and  the Islands a few times now, so another option would be to head over to Stranraer after Melrose and tour the Emerald Isle again. 

But Liz, reading about a church on Anglesey remind me that we haven't really **done** Wales. So let's explore that as a possibility. Nothing set in stone or even Welsh slate yet but worth exploring and that's what several upcoming posts are likely to do!
